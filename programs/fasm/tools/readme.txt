This directory contains some tools, which extract various types of information
from the symbolic information file generated by flat assembler, and present
them in a human-readable form.

The listing tool creates a listing of assembled code - this tool needs to be
executed in the exact configuration, in which the assembly was taking place.
All the source files and the output file aswell must not have been moved or
modified - if any of them was altered before generating the listing, it is
going to contain garbage instead of useful information. For example, if you
assembled the file with the command like:

  fasm example.asm example.exe -s example.fas

you should generate listing by immediately running this command from the same
directory:

  listing example.fas example.lst

In addition, the "-a" switch is recommended to use in the case of executable
formats, as it allows to get the run-time addresses for all the assembled code
and data.

The preprocessed source and symbols dump tools are simpler ones - they only
need the symbolic information file as input and generate proper output text
regardless of the availability of other files.
